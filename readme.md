# Network Intrusion Detection with NSL-KDD Dataset

This project involves building a network intrusion detection system using the NSL-KDD dataset. The model is designed to classify network connections as either normal or suspicious. The XGBoost algorithm has been utilized for this task due to its high performance and accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively detect network intrusions based on various features extracted from network traffic. The model is trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, which includes a range of features representing different aspects of network connections.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the NSL-KDD dataset, which includes the following columns:

- **`duration`**: Length of the connection in seconds.
- **`protocol_type`**: Protocol used (0 for TCP, 1 for UDP, 2 for ICMP).
- **`service`**: Network service used (various numerical values corresponding to different services).
- **`flag`**: Connection status (various numerical values corresponding to different flags).
- **`src_bytes`**: Number of bytes sent from source.
- **`dst_bytes`**: Number of bytes sent to destination.
- **`land`**: 1 if the connection is from and to the same host, 0 otherwise.
- **`wrong_fragment`**: Number of wrong fragments.
- **`urgent`**: Number of urgent packets.
- **`hot`**: Number of hot indicators.
- **`num_failed_logins`**: Number of failed login attempts.
- **`logged_in`**: 1 if the user is logged in, 0 otherwise.
- **`num_compromised`**: Number of compromised conditions.
- **`root_shell`**: 1 if the root shell is accessed, 0 otherwise.
- **`su_attempted`**: 1 if `su` (switch user) attempts are made, 0 otherwise.
- **`num_root`**: Number of root accesses.
- **`num_file_creations`**: Number of file creation operations.
- **`num_shells`**: Number of shell prompts.
- **`num_access_files`**: Number of file access operations.
- **`num_outbound_cmds`**: Number of outbound commands.
- **`is_host_login`**: 1 if the login is from a host, 0 otherwise.
- **`is_guest_login`**: 1 if the login is from a guest, 0 otherwise.
- **`count`**: Number of connections to the same host.
- **`srv_count`**: Number of connections to the same service.
- **`serror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `SYN` errors.
- **`srv_serror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `SYN` errors to the same service.
- **`rerror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `REJ` errors.
- **`srv_rerror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `REJ` errors to the same service.
- **`same_srv_rate`**: Rate of connections to the same service.
- **`diff_srv_rate`**: Rate of connections to different services.
- **`srv_diff_host_rate`**: Rate of connections to different hosts.
- **`dst_host_count`**: Number of connections to the destination host.
- **`dst_host_srv_count`**: Number of connections to the same service on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_same_srv_rate`**: Rate of connections to the same service on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_diff_srv_rate`**: Rate of connections to different services on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_same_src_port_rate`**: Rate of connections to the same source port on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate`**: Rate of connections to different hosts on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_serror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `SYN` errors on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_srv_serror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `SYN` errors to the same service on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_rerror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `REJ` errors on the destination host.
- **`dst_host_srv_rerror_rate`**: Rate of connections with `REJ` errors to the same service on the destination host.

The target column, **`attack`**, is labeled as follows:
- **0**: Normal
- **1**: Suspicious

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**
   - Prepare the dataset as described.
   - Use the provided script to train the model with XGBoost.

2. **Making Predictions**
   - Load the saved model using `joblib`.
   - Prepare new data in the same format as the training data.
   - Use the model to make predictions.

   ```python
   import joblib

   # Load the saved model
   loaded_model = joblib.load('final_xgboost_model.pkl')

   # Prepare new data (in the same format as the training data)
   new_data = [...]  # Replace with actual new data

   # Predict on new data
   new_predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
   ```
